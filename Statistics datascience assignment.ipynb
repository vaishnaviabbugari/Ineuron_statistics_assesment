    "### Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?"

It suggests that as SAT scores increase, there is a strong tendency for college GPA to also increase. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. The correlation coefficient only measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship, but it does not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between SAT scores and college GPA."
